# BDMLClass
Machine learning code used to perform classification based on brain imaging variables. 

This code will perform classification into two groups (Bipolar and controls) based on
derived brain imaging variables. Separate files are used to handle structural, functional,
and diffusion imaging data. The results can be combined using hard voting or soft voting
across the modalities
